We had a PC Maintenance workshop on 20/10/2024 at innovation lab. We learned how to correctly disassemble and reassemble a PC following the right steps.
The disassemble steps is :

1. remove the cover
2. unplug all the connecting wires
3. remove hard disk
4. remove power supply unit
5. remove RAM
6. remove fan and heatsink
7. After that, for the assemble steps just do the vice versa. This workshop also helped me understand the function of each PC hardware component and the potential consequences of hardware failure.
